Flake8
======

Flake8 is a wrapper around these tools:

-   PyFlakes
-   pycodestyle
-   Ned Batchelder's McCabe script

Flake8 runs all the tools by launching the single `flake8` command. It
displays the warnings in a per-file, merged output.

It also adds a few features:

-   files that contain this line are skipped:

        # flake8: noqa

-   lines that contain a `# noqa` comment at the end will not
    issue warnings.
-   you can ignore specific errors on a line with `# noqa: <error>`,
    e.g., `# noqa: E234`. Multiple codes can be given, separated
    by comma. The `noqa` token is case insensitive, the colon before the
    list of codes is required otherwise the part after `noqa` is ignored
-   Git and Mercurial hooks
-   extendable through `flake8.extension` and `flake8.formatting` entry
    points

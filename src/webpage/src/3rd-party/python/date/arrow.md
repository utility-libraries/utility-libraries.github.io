**Arrow** is a Python library that offers a sensible and human-friendly
approach to creating, manipulating, formatting and converting dates,
times and timestamps. It implements and updates the datetime type,
plugging gaps in functionality and providing an intelligent module API
that supports many common creation scenarios. Simply put, it helps you
work with dates and times with fewer imports and a lot less code.

Arrow is named after the [arrow of
time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time) and is heavily
inspired by [moment.js](https://github.com/moment/moment) and
[requests](https://github.com/psf/requests).

Why use Arrow over built-in modules?
------------------------------------

Python\'s standard library and some other low-level modules have
near-complete date, time and timezone functionality, but don\'t work
very well from a usability perspective:

-   Too many modules: datetime, time, calendar, dateutil, pytz and more
-   Too many types: date, time, datetime, tzinfo, timedelta,
    relativedelta, etc.
-   Timezones and timestamp conversions are verbose and unpleasant
-   Timezone naivety is the norm
-   Gaps in functionality: ISO 8601 parsing, timespans, humanization

Features
--------

-   Fully-implemented, drop-in replacement for datetime
-   Support for Python 3.6+
-   Timezone-aware and UTC by default
-   Super-simple creation options for many common input scenarios
-   `shift` method with support for relative offsets, including weeks
-   Format and parse strings automatically
-   Wide support for the [ISO
    8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard
-   Timezone conversion
-   Support for `dateutil`, `pytz`, and `ZoneInfo` tzinfo objects
-   Generates time spans, ranges, floors and ceilings for time frames
    ranging from microsecond to year
-   Humanize dates and times with a growing list of contributed locales
-   Extensible for your own Arrow-derived types
-   Full support for PEP 484-style type hints

Quick Start
-----------

### Installation

To install Arrow, use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/)
or [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org):

```console
$ pip install -U arrow
```

### Example Usage

```python
>>> import arrow
>>> arrow.get('2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+07:00')
<Arrow [2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+07:00]>

>>> utc = arrow.utcnow()
>>> utc
<Arrow [2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+00:00]>

>>> utc = utc.shift(hours=-1)
>>> utc
<Arrow [2013-05-11T20:23:58.970460+00:00]>

>>> local = utc.to('US/Pacific')
>>> local
<Arrow [2013-05-11T13:23:58.970460-07:00]>

>>> local.timestamp()
1368303838.970460

>>> local.format()
'2013-05-11 13:23:58 -07:00'

>>> local.format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss ZZ')
'2013-05-11 13:23:58 -07:00'

>>> local.humanize()
'an hour ago'

>>> local.humanize(locale='ko-kr')
'í•œì‹œê°„ ì „'
```

Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome for both code and localizations (adding and
updating locales). Begin by gaining familiarity with the Arrow library
and its features. Then, jump into contributing:

1.  Find an issue or feature to tackle on the [issue
    tracker](https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues). Issues marked
    with the [\"good first issue\"
    label](https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
    may be a great place to start!
2.  Fork [this repository](https://github.com/arrow-py/arrow) on GitHub
    and begin making changes in a branch.
3.  Add a few tests to ensure that the bug was fixed or the feature
    works as expected.
4.  Run the entire test suite and linting checks by running one of the
    following commands: `tox && tox -e lint,docs` (if you have
    [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) installed) **OR**
    `make build39 && make test && make lint` (if you do not have Python
    3.9 installed, replace `build39` with the latest Python version on
    your system).
5.  Submit a pull request and await feedback ðŸ˜ƒ.
